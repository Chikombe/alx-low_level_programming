0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

This project focuses on implementing and understanding doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

Doubly linked lists are a data structure that consist of nodes, where each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node in the sequence.
This project explores the implementation of doubly linked lists in C and provides a set of functions for common operations on these lists.

The main goals of this project are to:

Gain a deep understanding of doubly linked lists and their operations.
Develop proficiency in memory allocation, manipulation, and deallocation in C.
Practice modular programming by creating functions to perform specific tasks.
