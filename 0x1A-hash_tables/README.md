0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table is a data structure that allows efficient data retrieval based on a key. 

This project provides a hands-on experience in creating and manipulating hash tables, understanding hash functions, and handling collisions.

The project includes a set of C functions that allow you to perform various operations on hash tables, such as creating, adding, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs.

It is a fundamental data structure used in various real-world applications, including database indexing, caching systems, and more.

File descriptions for the files created:

hash_tables.h: This header file contains all the function prototypes and struct definitions used in the project.

0-hash_table_create.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_table_create function, which creates a new hash table.

1-djb2.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_djb2 function, which is a popular hash function used to calculate hash values for keys.

2-key_index.c: This file contains the implementation of the key_index function, which calculates the index in the hash table where a key should be stored.

3-hash_table_set.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_table_set function, which adds a key-value pair to the hash table.

4-hash_table_get.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_table_get function, which retrieves the value associated with a given key.

5-hash_table_print.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_table_print function, which prints the key-value pairs in the hash table.

6-hash_table_delete.c: This file contains the implementation of the hash_table_delete function, which deletes a hash table and its contents.

100-sorted_hash_table.c: This file contains additional advanced functions for sorting a hash table.
