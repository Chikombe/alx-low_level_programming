Welcome to Project 0x18! This project focuses on dynamic libraries in the C programming language.
Dynamic libraries are an essential concept in programming that allows for the modularization and efficient sharing of code across different programs.In this project, you will learn how to create, use, and manage dynamic libraries in C.

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are external pieces of code that can be loaded and linked at runtime.
They provide a way to separate code into smaller, reusable components, making the development and maintenance of software more manageable.
In this project, you will learn how to create dynamic libraries, link them to your programs, and utilize the benefits they offer.
